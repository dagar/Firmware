 *
 * The controller has two loops: P loop for angular error and PD loop for angular rate error.
 * Desired rotation calculated keeping in mind that yaw response is normally slower than roll/pitch.
 * For small deviations controller rotates copter to have shortest path of thrust vector and independently rotates around yaw,
 * so actual rotation axis is not constant. For large deviations controller rotates copter around fixed axis.
 * These two approaches fused seamlessly with weight depending on angular error.
 * When thrust vector directed near-horizontally (e.g. roll ~= PI/2) yaw setpoint ignored because of singularity.
 * Controller doesn't use Euler angles for work, they generated only for more human-friendly control and logging.
 * If rotation matrix setpoint is invalid it will be generated from Euler angles for compatibility with old position controllers.
