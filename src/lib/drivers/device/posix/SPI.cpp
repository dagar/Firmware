/**
 * @file spi.cpp
 *
 * Base class for devices connected via SPI.
 *
 * @todo Work out if caching the mode/frequency would save any time.
 *
 * @todo A separate bus/device abstraction would allow for mixed interrupt-mode
 * and non-interrupt-mode clients to arbitrate for the bus.  As things stand,
 * a bus shared between clients of both kinds is vulnerable to races between
 * the two, where an interrupt-mode client will ignore the lock held by the
 * non-interrupt-mode client.
